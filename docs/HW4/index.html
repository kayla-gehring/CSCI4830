      <h1>My Favorite Activity: Skating</h1>
      <p>I got my first pair of skates when I was three years old, and haven't been able to keep wheels off my feet since.</p>

      <!-- Subsection 1-->
      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      <p>That first pair of skates I was given where quads, but I switched to inlines early enough I don't even remember using quad skates. I don't even remember being taught to skate, though I remember many nights at the roller rink, zipping around on my inline skates.</p>

      <p>By the time I was in 4th grade, I would spend literal hours skating up and down the block my house was on. I had a Sony walkman that I would listen to while I skated. I knew most people in the neighborhood, thanks to my being outside alone so often, especially the elderly couples whom I loved to chat with about how school was going. Sometimes I would skate with my best friend and play make-believe, but she travelled a lot with her parents. </p>

      <!-- Subsection 2-->
      <h2>A Brief Foray to Ice Skates</h2>
      <p>At 12 years old, my dad suggested I try figure skating. I remember passing through the first 4 levels of the classes as fast as was possible, because I was so comfortable on skates already. By the time they started teaching me to spin, however, I got bored. At the time, I just wanted to go fast and listen to music. I wasn't interested in spending hours learning how to do anything fancy.</p>

      <p>Around that time, I was old enough to be allowed to go to the park on my own. So I would spend hours trail skating, instead of spending hours going in a large circle around my block.</p>

      <!-- Subsection 3-->
      <h2>Roller Derby</h2>
      <p>When I was 18, I joined the Air Force. For a couple of years, I couldn't skate very often. I had been stationed in Germany, and most roads in the village I lived in were made of brick - not a very conducive surface for skating. But then a Staff Sergeant in my squadron, whom I had mentioned my love of skating to, suggested I check out a roller derby team with her.</p>

      <p>At first, roller derby was really scary for me. I wanted to play, but the contact aspect of the sport was a little too frightening to get me to commit. Having to switch back to quads for the first time since I was 4 wasn't very easy for me, either. It wasn't until I was stationed in California, and the founder of a local derby team approached me while trail skating, that I started to discover how strong a fit roller derby really was for me.</p>

      <p>In California, skating with Flood Water Roller Derby, I learned the basics of roller derby and got over (most) of my fear of contact. I only skated with the team for a year or so, however, before my four-year enlistment was over. I moved back home, to Colorado. It took me a year and a half to find my next league, but I did eventually go back to derby.</p>

      <p>I've been skating with the Boulder County Bombers, now, for about 3 years. The challenge, teamwork, and time on skates are my favorite moments of just about every week.</p>
